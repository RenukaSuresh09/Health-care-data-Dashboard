***Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard - Power BI***
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze a healthcare dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes detailed information on inpatient and outpatient visits between 2018 and 2020. The dashboard uncovers trends, patterns, and key metrics that can help understand patient flow, resource utilization, and healthcare outcomes.

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized records related to:

Inpatient and outpatient visits

Patient demographics (age, gender)

Admission and discharge details

Diagnoses and procedure codes

Cost and length of stay

Visit year (2018–2020)

Source: Kaggle – Healthcare Dataset

(Replace # with the actual Kaggle dataset URL if available)

🎯 Objectives
Analyze trends in inpatient vs. outpatient visits from 2018 to 2020

Monitor average cost, length of stay, and readmission rates

Identify patient segments with the highest utilization

Enable filtering by demographics and time periods for better insights

📌 Key Features
Interactive Filters: Slicers by visit type, year, age group, and gender

KPIs: Total admissions, average cost per patient, readmission rate, average length of stay

Time Series Visuals: Trends across 2018, 2019, and 2020

Comparison Views: Inpatient vs. outpatient metrics side-by-side

Charts: Bar graphs, pie charts, line charts, and card visuals for key numbers

🛠️ Tools Used
Power BI Desktop

Power Query (for data cleaning and transformation)

DAX (for calculated columns and measures)

🚀 How to Use
Download the .pbix file from this repository

Open it using Power BI Desktop

Interact with the dashboard using the slicers and filters to explore insights

🧠 Key Insights
Outpatient visits were significantly higher than inpatient visits from 2018–2020

The average cost per inpatient visit increased slightly in 2020

Older patients (65+) had longer average lengths of stay and higher readmission rates

✅ Future Improvements
Integrate predictive analytics (e.g., forecast admissions or cost)

Include real-time data using APIs or live connections

Add advanced segmentation (e.g., by diagnosis groups or insurance type)
